# CS230 Operating Platforms: Module Eight Journal

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The client, The Gaming Room, currently has a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android systems and they wanted to expand it to other operating platforms. Specifically, to reach more users, they want to develop a mobile platform version available on both Android and iPhone app stores. As such, I developed components of the application so it may be deployed on various mobile operating platforms using the client-server architectural pattern. I also used Basic Authentication to build a username and password login interface by modifying the tutorial code. Additionally, I made recommendations to The Gaming Room for best-fit operating platforms to meet their application storage and memory needs. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I feel did a good job of learning about storage and memory requirements on varying operating platforms and applying my new knowledge to make suitable recommendations to the Gaming Room as to which platforms will fit their web application's specific needs the best. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
The design document forced me to work through and consider in-depth each aspect of the game application design before developing the application. This allowed me to develop the optimal design for my application since I had to consider each platform in depth and do adequate research to determine the best platform in order to work through the design document, before creating the application. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I feel my limited understanding of windows machines limited my ability to consider Windows' benefits and negatives determining what platforms are best for the application. Had I done more research on Windows' machines, I may have found areas of the application design of which Windows could be the best option. In the future, I would like to learn more about Windows so that I can use its platform when it is the best platform for specific design requirements.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
User's needs are the most important design constraint. If you do not consider users' specific needs, they may not use your platform. I tried to interpret the user’s needs and implement them into my software design by considering the optimal and most direct way to meet the Gaming Room's needs via choosing the most suitable platforms in order to meet the resource requirements of the users needs. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

In designing software, the guiding approach throughout the design process should be the user’s needs and design constraints. I approached designing the software based off the what platforms, designs, etc., will best meet these user needs. Additionally, a technique I will use in the future is planning and designing software via a design document in order to develop the optimal design for my application through in-depth research and thought-out planning. Additionally, I would like to design more RESTful APIs in order to make my application elements communicate with each other more effectively and securely.
